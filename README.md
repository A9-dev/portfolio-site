- **type**: category of progression (see below)
- **area**: optional focus area (e.g., `work`, `fitness`, `bjj`, `rust`)
- **summary**: short description in present tense
- Body text is optional and can provide detail or reflection.

## Types

- **learn**: something you studied or understood
- **work**: something you did at work
- **practice**: skill drills, repetition, or applied knowledge
- **achieve**: milestone, completed goal, or success
- **struggle**: obstacle, difficulty, or setback
- **reflect**: insight, realization, or retrospective thought
- **plan**: future step, target, or intention
- **meta**: change to the progression tracking system itself
