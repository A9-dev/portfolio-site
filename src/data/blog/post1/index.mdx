Today I decided to start tracking my personal and professional progression. I'm inspired by the "Conventional Commits" specification and I'm adapting it for my own use. I'm calling it "Conventional Progression".

I started by setting up this Astro site and defining the content collection for my progression logs.

I also spent some time learning Rust today. I was able to build a simple HTTP server using `async/await`, which was a great learning experience. However, I'm still finding the ownership model in Rust to be a bit tricky, especially in asynchronous contexts. I'll need to spend more time on that.
