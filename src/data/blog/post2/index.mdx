Today was a productive day. I spent some time practicing my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, specifically drilling lasso guard passes. It's a position I've been struggling with, so it was good to get some focused practice in.

At work, I was able to deliver a feature ahead of schedule, which was a great feeling.

I also had a moment of reflection today. I realized that I'm much more focused when my phone is in another room. I'm going to try to make that a more regular habit.

Finally, I did some planning for my fitness goals. I'm going to commit to a 30-day bodyweight workout challenge to get back into a consistent routine.
