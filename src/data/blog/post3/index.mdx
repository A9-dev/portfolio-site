As the day winds down, I'm reflecting on my productivity. I've noticed a significant improvement when I use timeboxing to manage my tasks. I'm going to make a conscious effort to do this more often.

To keep up my momentum with Rust, I'm planning to schedule a dedicated hour of study every morning. Consistency is key.
