## Software Engineer

### 👋 About Me

I’m a full-stack software engineer with a focus on **web applications, distributed systems, and developer experience**. I enjoy designing and building end-to-end systems that balance clean architecture with practical delivery.

My experience spans **front-end applications**, **back-end services**, and even experimental work with **low-level programming and graphics engines**. I like working on projects that combine curiosity with utility—educational tools, data-processing pipelines, and interactive applications that push technical boundaries.

Currently, I help maintain production systems, contribute to technical design, and take ownership of projects from concept to deployment.
