I'm a driven and outgoing full stack software engineer with a passion for systems design and building for the web!

I'm currently a full stack software engineer for [NquiringMinds Ltd](https://nquiringminds.com/), where I primarily design and develop intelligent and dynamic policy engines for a more secure and automated world of IoT networks üåê

## Personal Progression

I've always liked looking back at my GitHub activity and feeling satisfied with the progress, so to get more of that satisfaction I've started logging my personal progression!

### Progression Log

I've made up a style similar to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), with a focus on personal progression as a way to track my programming-related activity. I have yet to find someone that thinks this is as cool as I do üòÖ

<details>
  <summary>More on the format</summary>

Syntax: `<type>(<area>): <short summary>`

- **type**: category of progression
  - **learn**: something you studied or understood
  - **work**: something you did at work
  - **practice**: skill drills, repetition, or applied knowledge
  - **achieve**: milestone, completed goal, or success
  - **struggle**: obstacle, difficulty, or setback
  - **reflect**: insight, realization, or retrospective thought
  - **plan**: future step, target, or intention
- **area**: optional focus area (e.g. Work, Fitness, TypeScript)
- **summary**: short description in past tense (not strict)

### Areas of Focus

I'm always learning as much as I can!

| Topic               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Microservices**   | I'm exploring the advantages and disadvantages of microservices and the tools and technologies useful for its implementation. I'm currently reading through [Building Microservices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-2nd/9781492034018/). |
| **Cloud Computing** | Being able to easily deploy a highly available and fault tolerant application is quite fascinating, especially doing it all programmatically through something like [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform).                                           |
| **Leetcode**        | I like staying on top of data structures and algorithms and I have been using leetcode as a way to try new languages and get familiar with their syntax.                                                                                                              |
