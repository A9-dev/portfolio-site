## Software Engineer

### 👋 About Me

I’m a full-stack software engineer with a focus on **web applications, distributed systems, and developer experience**. I enjoy designing and building end-to-end systems that balance clean architecture with practical delivery.

My experience spans **front-end applications** and **back-end services**, with a strong interest in distributed systems and educational tools. I like working on projects that combine curiosity with utility—data-processing pipelines, interactive applications, and developer-focused libraries.

Currently, I help maintain production systems, contribute to technical design, and take ownership of projects from concept to deployment.
