### React Router 7

I've started looking more into React Router 7 as an alternative to Next.js for some projects, It's name has popped up a few times for me recently and I want to give myself more options in developing with react.

### Leetcode

These are the leetcode problems I solved today:

- [Median of two sorted arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)
- [Add two numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
- [Longest substring without repeating characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

### Go Web Services Project

I was listening to an interview with Flask creator Armin Ronacher who said Go is a great language for web services so I think I'll start a small web services project to get familiar with the language and ecosystem; since I'm also reading Building Microservices by Sam Newman I'll try to apply some principles from that book too.
