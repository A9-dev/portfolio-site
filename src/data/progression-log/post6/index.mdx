## Building Microservices

Link: https://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices_2nd_edition/

### Chapter 6, Workflow

This chapter offers a comparison of sagas and distributed transactions and
discusses their usefulness in modeling business processes involving multiple
microservices.

### Chapter 7, Build

This chapter explains mapping from a microservice to repositories and
builds.

### Moving Forward

The proceeding chapters in part II are about deployment, testing, and observability and then in part III the book goes on to topics such as team management for organisations implementing a microservices architecture.
I think at this point I will finish part II and then move on to actually starting a project as I think the most immediately practical information for me will have been covered by that point.
