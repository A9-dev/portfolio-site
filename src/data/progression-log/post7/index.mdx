## Distributed Notification System

Link: [https://github.com/A9-dev/distributed-notifications](https://github.com/A9-dev/distributed-notifications)

I built a small distributed notification system to get hands-on experience with RabbitMQ.
The project consists of two main components: a notification-event-emitter, and a text-notification handler which communicate through a RabbitMQ message queue.

The notification-event-emitter generates notification events and publishes them to a RabbitMQ exchange, while the text-notification handler subscribes to the relevant queue to process and display the notifications.

Doing this project taught me about concepts like message durability, acknowledgments and prefetch counts. It was also a good exercise in setting up a multi service project using docker and docker compose!
